RUNNING OUR EXERCISES:

To run each exercise the threads/Makefile DEFINES line must be changed 
to have the appropriate flags set(-DCHANGED, -DHW1_SEMAPHORES, -DHW1_LOCKS,
-DHW1_ELEVATOR). Then the files must be recompiled. 

To make that easier, we have added a python script named replace.py 
in the threas folder. The arguments are the flags you want set.

To run the simple thread exercise you would do:

   python replace.py -DCHANGED

To run the semaphore exercise you would do:

   python replace.py -DCHANGED -DHW1_SEMAPHORES

To run the lock exercise you would do:

   python replace.py -DCHANGED -DHW1_LOCKS

To run the elevator exercise you would do:

   python replace.py -DCHANGED -DHW1_ELEVATOR

If you do not put any flags, only -DTHREADS is set, which runs the 
original two-thread test.

If this is being tested on nachos.cs.fiu.edu, make sure the line

   s += "INCPATH = -I../threads -I../machine\n"

is NOT commented out.

The assignment is set to the unchanged version by default.

This script, along with our assignment seemed to work well in our own 
environments as well as the nachos.cs.fiu.edu environment. If for whatever
reason they do not work when you try them, please try changing the 
threads/Makefile manually, or as suggested in the Project 1 FAQ.

***Excercise 1: Simple Threading

We implemented the ThreadTest(int n) function as asked. This simply creates N 
new threads instead of one. Each thread loops 5 times as expected, and the -rs 
command makes them interleave more randomly. 

For the next step we used semaphores to synchronize the threads running 
SimpleThread(). If synchronization is not done properly, the SharedVariable will
be incremented to the incorrect number. This occurs because context switches may
occur before any assembly instructions. This means one thread can attempt to 
update a variable's value, but another thread can retrieve the same variable's 
value before the othe thread's update is complete. Outdated memory retrieval 
messes up the expected values. We use semaphors, locks, and conditions to stop 
such occurrances.

If the threads are properly synchronized, N threads are running, and each loops 
5 times, we should expect the value of SharedVariable to be 5N when all threads
have finished running(e.g. 3 threads makes SharedVariable end up as 15). 
With out synchronization the value is usually and incorrectly 5. 
Using Semaphores to synchronize the SimpleThread() function, the correct value 
is obtained. Random seeds do not change this either. Essentially, the 
critical section (the retrieval of the SharedValue and it's increment) is 
preceded by a P() call and followed by a V() call. Finally, a "barrier" is 
put up to stop early finishing threads from displaying the wrong result.


***Exercise 2: Implementing Locks

We implemented Locks to be near indentical to the Semaphore implementation. 
The primary difference is the internal value contained within it. 
It is always initialized to one. This allows only one thread to acquire 
the Lock at a time. The Lock also keeps track of which thread acquired 
it. Only the thread holding the Lock can successfully release it.
For testing, we implemented the same SimpleThread() function using 
Locks instead of Semaphores. The results were still the same as before. 
The SharedVariable sums up to 5N (N being the number of threads) as expected. 
Using the random seed option does not affect this.

Similar to the Semaphore solution, the critical section is preceded by an
Acquire() call, and followed by a Release() call.


***Exercise 3: Implementing Conditions

Conditions are also similar to semaphores and locks in implementation.
The primary difference is that the condition does not have a value to check
internally during it's function calls. There is a list of threads waiting
on the condition though. By waiting, we mean they are put in the
blocked state via a sleep() call. The Wait() function does this, assuming
the lock passed in is acquired by the thread calling it. Before putting itself
to sleep, the thread releases the lock, for use by other threads. Once, another
thread performs a Signal() or Broadcast(), a thread that was waiting on the 
condition will be awoken, and attempt to re-acquire the lock. The Signal()
function wakes a single thread waiting on the condition, while the Broadcast()
function wakes all threads waiting on the condition. These functions can only
work successfully if the thread calling them has acquired the Lock 
passed to them.

Our implementation of conditions seems to be correct. We successfully 
use them during the next exercise (the elevator problem).  

***Exercise 4: Elevator

We seem to have successfully implemented a simple elevator using conditions
and locks. Our implementationa uses only one Condition variable 
and one Lock variable. We have the following sharedvariables:
    
    1. An array of Floor structs, where each Floor struct has 2 int variables.
       One int represents the number of people on a floor wishing to 
       enter the elevator, and the other the number of people wanting to exit
       the elevator on that floor.
    2. The current Floor value.
    3. The number of people in the elevator.

The use of these shared data must be synchronized. If they are not, errors
start to occur. A person thread may miss the elevator when it should have
entered it. People may enter the elevator when it is on the wrong floor, 
and so on. 

The elevator must acquire the Lock before it changes the floor it is on.
It then broadcasts, waking every thread waiting on the condition. It then
waits on the condition while there are still people wanting to get off the
current floor (known by the floor structure for the current floor). This
gives person threads a change to get on and off the elevator. 
The elevator is awakened by every person thread that either gets on the
elevator or gets off it, allowing it to recheck if there are more people
getting off on the floor. Once there are no more people getting off, 
the elevator wakes every thread waiting via a broadcast, and waits 
on the condition while there are people trying to get on the elevator,
and there is still room.

A person thread starts by increasing the number of people wanting to get on
the elevator from the floor it is on via the floor structure representing 
it's floor. It then waits on the condition while the elevator is 
not on its floor or the elevator is full.  This allows the elevator to skip
picking up someone if it is full at the time it arrives on a floor 
with a person waiting.  Once the person thread is awakened, it 
"gets on the elevator". This is done by decrementing the number of people 
getting on on the floor it's at, and increments the getting off value of the
floor it wants to exit on. It also increases the number of peopel occupying
the elevator. This is done while still owning the lock. 
It also broadcasts waking all threads waiting on the condition (possibly 
and likely including the elevator). It then waits on the condition until
the current floor is the floor it desired to get off on.  The elevator broadcasts
everytime it reaches a floor, so the person thread would be woken up at this point.
Once the elevator reaches the correct floor, and the person threadis woken up,
it decrements the number of people occupying the elevator as well as the 
number of people getting off on that floor (in the floor structure).

Our implementation seems to work well, with and without a random seed specified.
We tested it on varying floor numbers, varying numbers of people threads, and
with scenarios that make the elevator reach max occupancy and not. The sample 
output given is stopped by us, as currently, there is no mechanism 
in place to stop the elevator from running forever.


Overall, this assigment was a good experience in synchronization programming.
We see the importance of atomic actions in synchronizing critical sections.
